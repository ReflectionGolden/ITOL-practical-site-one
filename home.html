        <p id="description">
            Magium is a Choose Your Own Adventure game in the Fantasy genre, which was originally written, programmed,
            and released by a single person named Cristian Mihailescu. He was able to release the first three books in
            their entirety, but he passed away leaving an amazing community behind who have taken up the mantle to use
            his plans for the game's future to not only continue the story he created, but also to rerelease the story
            with brand new implementations of the original story.
