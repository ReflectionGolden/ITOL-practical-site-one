        <p id="description">
            <strong>Magium</strong> is a Choose Your Own Adventure game in the Fantasy genre, which was originally
            written, programmed, and released by a single person named <em>Cristian Mihailescu</em>, also known by his online
            name <em>black_whirlwind45</em>. He was able to release the first three books in their entirety, but he passed
            away leaving an amazing community behind who have taken up the mantle to use his plans for the game's future
            to not only continue the story he created, but also to rerelease the story with brand new implementations of
            the game using more sophisticated frameworks.
