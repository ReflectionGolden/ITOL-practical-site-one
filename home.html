            Magium is a Choose Your Own Adventure game in the Fantasy genre, which was originally written, programmed, and
            released by a single person named Cristian Mihailescu. He was able to release the first three books in their
            entirety, but he passed away leaving an amazing community behind who have taken up the mantle to use his plans
            for the game's future to not only continue the story he created, but also to rerelease the story with brand new
            implementations of the original story.
