            <p>
                Magium Dev is the first project made to recreate the original 3 books in a playable form with javascript
                in order to preserve the story since Magium has been taken off the appstores that it used to be offered
                on.<br>The project is currently not fully complete (in that the game is not fully recreated all the way
                up to the end of book 3, and some mechanics such as achievements have not been fully implemented) but as
                it is open source it is possible for anyone interested to view the progress and even contribute.

            <p>
                Magium: Recrystallized is the second project and headded by a person going by the name
                <em>'Br3nnabee'</em> with the application being built using Svelte, Typescript, and WebAssembly while
                being packaged via Tauri in order to support various platforms. It is currently in the early stages,
                with a number of tickets open in Github for people who want to contibute to know what needs doing if
                they have the knowledge of the relevant languages.<br>The application is not currently in a properly
                playable state, althought as an open source project the progress can be seen by anyone and anyone who
                has the relevant knowledge can contribute.
